============
 OpenKardia
============
 
 A simulation of a heart, essentially complete, but working on a GUI to add also.
 
 Maybe will abandon this project and work on the GUI somewhere else.

=================
 GUI thing files
=================
 The file itself:

uint16_t n : How many things
thing_t things[n]

 GUI files adhere to the GUI module's enums and stuff, they are just file-ized, with dynamic arrays becoming static arrays, that's all.

 gui_u_t is int16_t as of now.

 thing_t is defined as follows:

thing_t
{
  uint8_t type

  uint16_t id_s : size of id
  uint16_t str_s : size of str AKA text

  uint8_t[id_s] id
  uint8_t[str_s] str : AKA text

  gui_u_t x
  gui_u_t y

  gui_u_t w
  gui_u_t min_w
  gui_u_t max_w

  gui_u_t h
  gui_u_t min_h
  gui_u_t max_h

  NOW IT DEPENDS ON TYPE

  if type = itext:
    uint8_t format
  
  if type = window:
    uint16_t child

  if type = rowmap:
    uint8_t rows_n : How many rows
    uint8_t[rows_n] cols_n : Number of columns per row index
    uint16_t[SUM OF cols_n TIMES rows_n] children : Number of cols_n members
}

===========
 Compiling
===========

 There is the main makefile for kardia/thinger/etc, the binaries that work on top of the engine, all you do is enter it and change the PROJECT_NAME to the right one you want to compile.
 
 You also need to compile the engine, enter the directory and just make. also read the readme there for more info.
