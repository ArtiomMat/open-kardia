============
 OpenKardia
============
 
 A simulation of a heart, essentially complete, but working on a GUI to add also.
 
 Maybe will abandon this project and work on the GUI somewhere else.

===========
 Compiling
===========

 There is the main makefile for kardia/thinger/etc, the binaries that work on top of the engine, all you do is enter it and change the PROJECT_NAME to the right one you want to compile.
 
 You also need to compile the engine, enter the directory and just make. also read the readme there for more info.
